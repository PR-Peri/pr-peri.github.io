    <h2>Exploring Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphone Data Set</h2>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Human Activity Recognition (HAR) plays a crucial role in various fields such as healthcare, sports, and smart
        devices. It involves detecting and classifying human activities based on sensor data. In this blog post, we will
        explore the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set, which consists of recordings of 30 subjects
        performing daily activities while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors. We will
        delve into the dataset, analyze the data, and build a deep learning model using LSTM to accurately classify
        different activities.
    </p>

    <h2> Understanding the Dataset </h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        The dataset consists of experiments conducted with 30 volunteers, aged between 19 and 48 years. Each person
        performed six activities: WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, and LAYING. The
        smartphone, a Samsung Galaxy S II, was attached to the waist of each subject. The embedded accelerometer and
        gyroscope sensors captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz.
        The dataset was manually labeled using video recordings, and it was randomly partitioned into training and test
        sets, with 70% and 30% of volunteers, respectively.
    </p>

    <h2> Data Preprocessing </h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Data Preprocessing:<br>
        Before diving into the analysis, we need to preprocess the data. This involves applying noise filters,
        separating gravitational and body motion components, and calculating variables from the time and frequency
        domain. The preprocessed data is then stored in the training and test sets.
    </p>

    <h2> Exploratory Data Analysis </h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        To gain insights into the dataset, we perform exploratory data analysis. We start by checking the shape and
        datatype of the training and test data. The training set contains 7352 rows and 562 columns, while the test set
        contains 2947 rows and 562 columns. The dataset includes 561 features, which represent different aspects of
        human activities.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">We also examine the distribution of activities in the dataset. Through interactive
        plots and bar graphs, we observe that the data is well-balanced, with activities equally distributed among the
        subjects. Additionally, we analyze box plots to understand the distribution of acceleration features for
        different activities. This helps us identify the significant features for classification, such as
        tBodyAccMagmean and tBodyAccJerkMagmean.
    </p>

    <h2>Dimensionality Reduction </h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Since the dataset has high dimensionality, it becomes challenging to visualize and interpret. To overcome this,
        we employ t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) for dimensionality reduction. By reducing the
        dimensions to two, we can plot the data points on a scatter plot and observe the separation of activities. The
        t-SNE visualizations reveal that all activities except standing and sitting are well-distributed, indicating the
        effectiveness of the smartphone in detecting movements.
    </p>

    <h2> Feature Engineering </h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        In addition to the raw sensor data, we can engineer additional features to improve the performance of our
        classification model. By calculating statistical measures such as mean, standard deviation, and correlation
        coefficients, we can capture more nuanced information about the activities. These engineered features provide a
        more comprehensive representation of the data and enhance the discriminative power of our model.
    </p>

    <h2>Building a Deep Learning Model</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        To classify the activities accurately, we construct a deep learning model using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory).
        LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that can capture temporal dependencies in sequential data. We
        load the sensor
        data and corresponding activity labels, splitting them into training and test sets. The LSTM model is trained
        for 50 epochs to learn the patterns and relationships between sensor data and activities. We utilize techniques
        such as batch normalization and dropout to improve the model's generalization and prevent overfitting. Finally,
        we evaluate the model on the test set and report the accuracy achieved.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Human Activity Recognition using smartphone data sets is a fascinating field with diverse applications. By
        leveraging machine learning techniques, we can accurately classify various activities and gain insights into
        human behavior. In this article, we explored the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set,
        performed data preprocessing, conducted exploratory data analysis, employed dimensionality reduction, engineered
        features, and built a deep learning model using LSTM. The results highlight the effectiveness of smartphone
        sensor data in recognizing human activities and provide a foundation for further research and applications in
        this domain.
