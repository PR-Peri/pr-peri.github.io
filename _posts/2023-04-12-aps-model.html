    <h2>Predicting Air Pressure System Failures in Scania Trucks</h2>
</head>

<body>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Air pressure system failures in trucks can lead to serious safety hazards and expensive repairs. In this blog
        post, we will explore a machine learning approach to predict air pressure system failures in Scania trucks. We
        will go through various steps, including data preprocessing, data visualization, feature selection, model
        selection and training, model evaluation, model tuning, and final model selection and deployment. By following
        these steps, we can develop an accurate model that can help identify potential failures in the air pressure
        system of Scania trucks, enabling proactive maintenance and minimizing downtime.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        The first step in our analysis is data preprocessing. We read the training and testing datasets into pandas
        dataframes using the <code>reading_dataset_into_df()</code> function. The training dataset has 60,000 rows and
        171 columns, while the testing dataset has 16,000 rows and 171 columns. We then check for missing values in the
        datasets and drop columns with missing values greater than 50% using the
        <code>check_missing_values_and_drop_col()</code> function. This ensures that we are working with clean and
        complete data.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Next, we perform feature selection to reduce the dimensionality of our dataset. We use the Principal Component
        Analysis (PCA) algorithm, implemented in the <code>pca_transformation()</code> function. PCA helps us identify
        the most important features that contribute to the variance in the data. We visualize the explained variance
        ratio using a bar plot generated by the <code>px.bar()</code> function from the Plotly library.
    </p>

    <p>
        After feature selection, we split the dataset into training and testing sets using the
        <code>splitting_train_and_test_sets()</code> function. This allows us to train our model on the training set and
        evaluate its performance on the testing set. We use an 80:20 split, with 80% of the data used for training and
        20% for testing.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        We consider three machine learning algorithms for our prediction task: Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and
        Naive Bayes. We define a list of models and their corresponding parameter grids in the <code>models</code> and
        <code>param_grids</code> variables. We then use the <code>test_predict_grid()</code> function to train each
        model using the training data and evaluate its performance using cross-validation. This function performs a grid
        search over the parameter grid for each model, finding the best hyperparameters that maximize the chosen
        performance metric.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        In the model evaluation step, we compute several performance metrics for each model, including accuracy,
        precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC AUC score. These metrics provide insights into how well the models are
        performing in predicting air pressure system failures. We store the model names, metrics, and scores in the
        <code>result_df</code> dataframe.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        If the model's performance is not satisfactory, we can perform model tuning using Grid Search. Grid Search helps
        us find the optimal hyperparameters for each model by systematically searching through a predefined grid of
        parameter values. We can modify the <code>param_grids</code> variable to include additional parameter options
        for each model and rerun the <code>test_predict_grid()</code> function to find the best performing model with
        tuned hyperparameters.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Based on the evaluation metrics in the <code>result_df</code> dataframe,

        we select the model with the best performance as our final model. We choose the model that achieves the highest
        prediction score. We define the chosen model in the <code>choosing_best_model()</code> function, which returns
        the model object for further analysis or deployment.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        In conclusion, our analysis demonstrates a systematic approach for predicting air pressure system failures in
        Scania trucks. By performing data preprocessing, feature selection, model selection and training, model
        evaluation, and potentially model tuning, we can develop an accurate model for proactive maintenance and
        minimizing downtime.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">Through our analysis, we identified the best-performing model based on evaluation
        metrics such as accuracy,
        precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC AUC score. This model can effectively predict air pressure system failures
        in Scania trucks, enabling timely maintenance interventions and enhancing safety.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">Implementing this predictive model in real-world scenarios can have significant
        benefits for truck operators,
        allowing them to proactively address potential issues, reduce repair costs, and optimize the utilization of
        their fleet. Ultimately, this approach contributes to improving overall operational efficiency and ensuring the
        reliability of Scania trucks.
