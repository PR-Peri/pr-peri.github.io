    <h1>Analyzing Twitter Data: User Tweets and Hashtag Analysis</h1>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        In today's digital age, social media platforms have become a rich source of information and insights.
        Twitter, in particular, offers a wealth of user-generated content that can provide valuable insights into
        various topics,
        trends, and public sentiment. In this blog post, we will explore how to scrape and analyze tweets from specific
        users
        and hashtags using Python and various data analysis techniques.
    </p>

    <h2>Setting up the Environment</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Before we dive into the code, let's ensure that we have the necessary libraries and credentials in place.
        We will be using the Tweepy library to access the Twitter API, Pandas for data manipulation, and several other
        libraries
        for data analysis and visualization.
    </p>
    <p>
        First, make sure you have the required libraries installed by running the following command:
    </p>
    <pre><code>!pip install tweepy pandas numpy spacy torch seaborn matplotlib nltk gensim transformers sklearn wordcloud networkx</code></pre>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Next, you'll need to set up your Twitter API credentials. If you don't have them yet,
        you can apply for a developer account on the Twitter Developer Portal (<a
            href="https://developer.twitter.com/">https://developer.twitter.com/</a>).
        Once you have your consumer key, consumer secret, access token, and access token secret,
        replace the empty strings in the code with your actual credentials.
    </p>

    <h2>Scraping User Tweets</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        The first task we'll tackle is scraping tweets from specific Twitter users.
        We have a list of target users, including "LloydsBank," "MyMaybank," "ZenithBank," "NatWest_Help," "Nedbank,"
        and "talktoBOI."
        We'll use the <code>scrape_user_tweets</code> function to fetch the tweets from these users.
        The function takes the list of usernames and the number of tweets to scrape as input.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        The <code>scrape_user_tweets</code> function utilizes the Tweepy library to authenticate with the Twitter API
        and fetch user tweets using the <code>user_timeline</code> endpoint.
        For each tweet, we extract relevant information such as the tweet text, date, time, and Twitter handle.
        We also fetch additional details like reply count, retweet count, favorite count, hashtags, user mentions,
        media URLs, and more.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        The scraped tweets are stored in a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a tweet.
        Finally, we convert the list of dictionaries into a Pandas DataFrame for further analysis.
    </p>

    <h2>Scraping Hashtag Tweets</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Next, let's move on to scraping tweets based on specific hashtags.
        We have a list of hashtags, including "LloydsBank," "Maybank," "ZenithBank," "Natwest," "Nedbank," and
        "BankOfIreland."
        We'll use the <code>scrape_hashtag_tweets</code> function to fetch tweets containing these hashtags.
        The function takes the list of hashtags and the number of tweets to scrape as input.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        The <code>scrape_hashtag_tweets</code> function utilizes the Tweepy library to authenticate with the Twitter API
        and fetch hashtag tweets using the <code>search_tweets</code> endpoint.
        Similar to scraping user tweets, we extract various details from each tweet, including the tweet text, date,
        time,
        user name, location, followers count, following count, profile URL, profile image URL, and more.
    </p>
    <p>
        The scraped hashtag tweets are also stored in a list of dictionaries and converted into a Pandas DataFrame.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Preprocessing</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Now that we have scraped the user tweets and hashtag tweets, we can proceed with data preprocessing
        to clean and prepare the text data for analysis. We have several functions to help us in this process:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <code>clean_tweet_text</code>: This function cleans the tweet text by removing URLs, retweet tags, aliases,
            emojis,
            unwanted characters, and converting the text to lowercase.
            It also tokenizes the text, removes stopwords, and lemmatizes the remaining tokens.
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>rename_columns</code>: This function renames the columns of the user and hashtag tweet DataFrames
            to provide more descriptive names.
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>preprocess_text</code>: This function applies the <code>clean_tweet_text</code> function to the tweet
            text
            column of the user and hashtag tweet DataFrames, creating a new column called "clean_text" that contains
            the preprocessed text.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        By applying these preprocessing functions, we can clean the tweet text, remove unnecessary information,
        and convert the text into a more suitable format for analysis.
    </p>

    <h2>Analyzing User Tweets</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        With the preprocessed user tweet data at our disposal, we can now perform various analyses
        and gain insights into user behavior and engagement. Here are a few examples:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Tweet Count by User</strong>: We can calculate the number of tweets posted by each user
            and visualize the results using a bar chart.
            This analysis gives us an overview of the user's activity on Twitter.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Most Common Hashtags and User Mentions</strong>: We can extract the most common hashtags and user
            mentions
            from the user tweets and create word clouds or frequency plots to visualize the results.
            This analysis helps us understand the topics and users that the target users engage with the most.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Engagement Metrics</strong>: We can calculate engagement metrics such as the average number of
            retweets,
            favorites, and replies for each user.
            By visualizing these metrics, we can identify the tweets that received the most engagement.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Analyzing Hashtag Tweets</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Similar to user tweets, we can perform various analyses on the preprocessed hashtag tweet data.
        Here are a few examples:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Tweet Count by Hashtag</strong>: We can calculate the number of tweets for each hashtag
            and visualize the results using a bar chart.
            This analysis gives us an idea of the popularity and volume of tweets related to each hashtag.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Top Locations and User Followers</strong>: We can extract the top locations mentioned in the hashtag
            tweets
            and analyze the distribution of user followers.
            This analysis helps us understand the geographical distribution of tweets and the potential reach
            of users discussing the hashtags.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Sentiment Analysis</strong>: We can use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques
            to perform sentiment analysis on the tweet text.
            This analysis allows us to determine the overall sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) associated
            with each hashtag and visualize the sentiment distribution.
        </li>
    </ol>
